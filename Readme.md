Lung Cancer Prediction

Abstract
This repository contains code for a lung cancer prediction model using machine learning techniques. The model aims to predict the likelihood of an individual developing lung cancer based on various features such as age, gender, air pollution exposure, and more. Lung cancer is a serious and prevalent disease, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Machine learning models can play a significant role in identifying individuals at higher risk.

Prerequisites
Before running the code in this repository, you will need the following libraries and tools:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook or an integrated development environment (IDE)
Required Python libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, xgboost, joblib
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn xgboost joblib

Data Importing
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('cancer_patient_data.csv')

Data Preprocessing
# Data cleaning and preprocessing
df = df.drop_duplicates()
Model Training
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from xgboost import XGBClassifier

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X = df.drop(columns=['Patient Id', 'Level'])
y = df['Level']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the classifiers
svm = SVC()
rf = RandomForestClassifier()
svm.fit(X_train, y_train)
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)
Model Evaluation
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Make predictions
svm_predictions = svm.predict(X_test)
rf_predictions = rf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the models
svm_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, svm_predictions)
rf_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, rf_predictions)

print(f"SVM Model Accuracy: {svm_accuracy}")
print(f"Random Forest Model Accuracy: {rf_accuracy}")

# You can also generate classification reports for detailed analysis
print("SVM Classification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, svm_predictions))

print("Random Forest Classification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, rf_predictions))

Usage
You can use this code to build a lung cancer prediction model based on your dataset. Feel free to customize the code and adapt it to your specific data and requirements.
